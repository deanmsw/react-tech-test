### React Tech Test

---

Inside this directory you'll find a JSON payload which is a typical API response you can expect to receive when working on one of Pentest People's web applications. The JSON data includes a list of vulnerabilities and each vulnerability's associated information.

Your goal is to consume the data provided, using a package like Axios or the Fetch API (whichever approach you prefer), and create a small React application that displays a list of vulnerabilities and allows you to view each vulnerability in a separate view when selected. Users should be able to return back to the main list of vulnerabilities after viewing an individual vulnerability.

The UI should be fit for purpose but don't focus too much on making it pixel perfect. We're looking more at how you structure your application, how you organise your code, how you handle navigating between routes and the approach you take to consuming and displaying data.
